1. Coding task:

    In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object which can be modified after it is created. 

    Classes should be immutable unless there's a very good reason to make them mutable. If a class cannot be made immutable, limit its mutability as much as possible. The JDK contains many immutable classes, including String, the boxed primitive classes, and BigInteger and etc. Basically the immutable classes are less prone to error. 

    Please implement an immutable queue with the following api:
	
    Scala Version:
    ```scala
	trait Queue[T] {
	  def isEmpty: Boolean
	  def enQueue(t: T): Queue[T]
	  # Removes the element at the beginning of the immutable queue, and returns the new queue.
	  def deQueue(): Queue[T]
	  def head: Option[T]
	}
	object Queue {
	  def empty[T]: Queue[T] = ???
	}
    ```

    Java Version:
    ```java
	public interface Queue[T] {
	    public Queue<T> enQueue(T t);
	    #Removes the element at the beginning of the immutable queue, and returns the new queue.
	    public Queue<T> deQueue();
	    public T head();
	    public boolean isEmpty();
	}
    ```
